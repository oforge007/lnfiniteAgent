## 🛑 Problem Statement

Emerging market users struggle to access global forex markets due to a range of barriers that Infinite addresses:

1. **Barriers to Global FX Access**:
   - High infrastructure costs, stringent regulations, and minimum capital requirements block access to traditional forex platforms.
   - While DeFi promises decentralization, current solutions are too complex for everyday users without technical expertise.

2. **Manual Trading Inefficiencies**:
   - DeFi platforms today require constant user monitoring for swaps, making participation difficult for those with limited time or access.

3. **No AI-Driven Automation**:
   - Existing trading tools lack intelligent automation features that trigger trades efficiently. Users rely either on centralized platforms (trust issues) or manual participation.

4. **Security Risks in Automated Solutions**:
   - Trustless automation remains elusive in decentralized trading. CeFi counterparts face asset custody problems, while DeFi lacks fully automated, secure solutions.

5. **Desktop-Focused Trading**:
   - People in emerging markets, where Infinite thrives, rely largely on mobile devices. Existing tools are designed for desktop use and consume significant bandwidth.

## 🔑 Solution

Infinite Agent redefines FX trading with its all-encompassing approach:

1. **AI-Powered Trigger Execution**:
   - Users set trading triggers (e.g., price targets, volume thresholds).
   - AI agents continuously monitor Mento FX rates and execute swaps when conditions are met, eliminating manual intervention.

2. **User-Controlled Smart Contracts**:
   - All trades execute via decentralized, autonomous smart contracts:
     - Per-user spending limits and daily caps.
     - Mandatory rate limiting (5-second intervals between executions).
     - Full audit trails for each transaction.
     - Enforced slippage tolerances for accurate execution.

3. **Secure Key Management**:
   - Private keys are encrypted using AES-256-GCM standards.
   - Secure transaction signing through integrated policy engines (leveraging patterns from Turnkey), preventing unauthorized or suspicious execution patterns.

4. **Mento + Uniswap v4 Integration**:
   - Swaps are executed via Mento’s vAMM for optimal FX rates.
   - If Mento rates are unfavorable, Uniswap v4 automatically acts as a fallback, ensuring users always get the best possible rates.

5. **Mobile-First, Bandwidth-Friendly Design**:
   - An interface fully optimized for small screens and touch controls.
   - Responsive footer navigation, compact cards, and network efficiency tuned for 2G/3G connections—ensuring inclusivity for users in emerging regions.

6. **Real-Time Security Monitoring**:
   - A comprehensive dashboard tracks all trade executions.
   - Anomaly detection features monitor for unusual patterns (e.g., volume spikes, repeated execution failures, bot-like activity).
   - Instant user notifications for detected anomalies.

## 📈 Use Case Example

Imagine a user in an emerging market who needs to secure GBP currency without access to traditional forex services. With limited bandwidth and access only via a mobile device:

1. The user defines trade triggers (e.g., "Buy GBP when cUSD/cGBP dips below $0.75; sell when it goes above $0.85").
2. The AI-powered system automatically executes these trades through user-controlled smart contracts, recording a real-time audit trail.
3. The user monitors progress through a mobile-friendly dashboard while the security system identifies anomalies.
